    <h2> I am doing this course as my full time thing! :)</h2>
    <p> I am a psychology graduate from Swansea University, I recently (last week) quit my job as a office manager at a farm local to me. I enjoy surfing
        in my spare time, and still spend a lot of my spare time down on the Welsh coast.
