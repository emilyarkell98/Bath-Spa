<h3>Danger! </h3>

<p> Yeah, you could go to a normal school and feel all safe... Or you could come here where we will actively throw 
    you in to life threatening situations!<br>
    <br>

    We will ease you in gently, where you will enjoy the delights of backfiring spells exploding in your face.
    From there we will progress you to fighting an assortment of dangerous creatures. You may even get the
    opportunity to risk your life against huge dragons for sport! Cool as, right?
    <br> <br>
    Even some of our staff are happy to concuss you with a book if you don't look like you are studying.
